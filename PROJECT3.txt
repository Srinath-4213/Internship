DOMAIN: vulnweb.com
subdomain: http://testasp.vulnweb.com/
	
Steps To Reproduce:
Step 1: Visit http://testasp.vulnweb.com/
Step 2: On the top menu you will find a search option.
Step 3: Click on it and you will be prompted with the Search box.
Step 4: You can intercept the request in Burp Suite
Step 5: Now you can find different payloads for XSS. 
Step 6: Send the request to the intruder and paste all the payloads.
Step 7: Try to find a successful payload for XSS.
Step 8: Prepare a report for it.

To reproduce this, an attacker has to:
Prepare a Javascript payload that it wants the victim to execute.
<script>alert("same")</script>
Inject this Javascript code properly into the vulnerable parameter, creating thus a crafted future GET request that will inject the payload.
